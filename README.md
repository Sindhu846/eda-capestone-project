# eda-capestone-project
exploratory data analysis has been performed on hotel booking data set 
and tried to obtain information based on previous data. Matplotlib and seaborn of python is used to 
perform EDA. Initially data collection and data cleaning has been done. Then for analysis project is 
divided into many parts. They are univariate analysis, Hotel analysis, Cancellation analysis, Room type 
analysis, Resesrvation type analsis, Parking Space analysis and Special request analysis. Hotel booking 
analysis will help the hotel management to understand the patterns in booking and about customers. It 
helps to increase the revenue and profit of the hotel.

### DATASET:

We were provided with 32 datasets and 119390 rows. The given datasets are: 'hotel', 'is_canceled', 'lead_time', 'arrival_date_year', 'arrival_date_month', 'arrival_date_week_number', 'arrival_date_day_of_month', 'stays_in_weekend_nightsâ€™, 'stays_in_week_nights', 'adults', 'children', 'babies', 'meal', 'country', 'market_segment', 'distribution_channel', 'is_repeated_guest', 'previous_cancellations 'previous_bookings_not_canceled', 'reserved_room_type', 'assigned_room_type', 'booking_changes', 'deposit_type', 'agent', 'company', 'days_in_waiting_list', 'customer_type', 'adr', 'required_car_parking_spaces', 'total_of_special_requests', 'reservation_status', 'reservation_status_date'.
### DATA CLEANING

To remove missing values and Replace the null/NaN values.
- It is observed that agent and company column has null values so replacing null 
values in country and agent clumn with 0.
- Replacing missing values in children column with mean of that column. This column 
has zero as value so it is inappropriate to replace missing value with 0.
- Column country is objective type so to deal with missing value replacing missing 
values in country column with the mode of country column.

Converting some of the columns datatype:

- Datatype of children,agent and company if float64, converting that to int64.
- reservation_status_date column datatype is changed to data_type

Removing of unnecessary rows/columns.

- There is 31994 rows of duplicate values, removing of such rows.
- some rows have zero values in adults, children and babies columns. There is 166 
rows of such type dropping that rows

questions for which answers are explored are as follows:

- Now analyzing the change of trend in special requests made yearwise?
- predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special 
requests

### CONCLUSION:

- The arrival of guests is more in August and july
- The most bookings is made by company 40 and agent 9. 
- About 78% of guests has ordered BB(bread and breakfast).
- Most of the customers are from Portugal(PRT). Bookings from other countries are very less.

hotel.
- City hotel has more chances of putting it's customer in waiting list. This is because due to city 
hotel receives more bookings.
